## Think of all the kids - TOAK

In face of the current panpanic, governments are running crazy and people who don't wash their hands but shake alot decide to close down schools and childcare institutions until further notice. This is going to have a devastating effect on social development of the children, education and the healtcare system, because the system depends heavily on women and men.

The intent of this project is to offer parents the possibility to pool their children into small, consistent childcare groups in order to keep the system running and prevent the uncalcululabe fallout this might have.
